# About: 

The goal of this project was to build a image classifier in R using Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Deep Learning and Support Vector Machine. The model classifies an image based on the feature and learns with the label provided such as in our case that the picture is of a cat or a dog.

# Requirement:
The script is written in R, the required packages are as follows: `naiveBayes` `randomForest` `deeplearning` `kernlab` `h2o` `tidyverse` `caTools` `rvest` `imager`.

# Data Split
The data was split using a split ratio of 0.75 and the `set.seed()` utilized was 12345. The naiveBayes, randomForest and Deep Learning models were used with h2o package which is a scalable machine learning platform. It utilizes in-memory compression which makes it very robust. 

# Models: 
## Naive Bayes Model
The first model utilizes the `h2o.naiveBayes` to classify the images 



## Time Series Analysis
The second model utilizes time series data to forecast the future price for the next
minutes if the actual price matches the predicted and is less than it executed the 
function

This not so complex algorithm helped us secure a poition in the top 3 which sparks a thought in our mind that is the stock market just a gamble? Both involve risk and look to maximize profit, but at what cost?
